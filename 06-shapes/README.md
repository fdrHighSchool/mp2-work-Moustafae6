we are going to need to make 2 for loops and on the first one we will need to start with zero and mulitply it by 3 after that u add 1 and mulirtply  it agaid and u doing it for 9 times


2. Write a plan for the following output:
```
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
```

it would be the samething as the other one but insteead of increasing the number  we gonna subrtact it by 1 and the we start from 9 and and at 1.
