# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    it removes string from a bigger string like taking a letter out of a word

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    it removes a part of the word

  * `.indexOf(str)`
it tell you where is the postion of the letter or character
  * `.equals(str)`
its the same thing as == but for strings 

2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
start at 0 and keep going if i is less than the length of s.
